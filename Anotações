Static websites are ones that are fixed and display the same content for
every user usually written exclusively in HTML

Dynamic website on the other hand is one that can display different
content and provide user interaction, by making use of advanced programming and databases in addition to HTML
As you can tell static websites are easier to create while dynamic websites require more work

the world wide web is about communication between web clients and
web servers

Clients- are often browsers(Chrome,Edge,Safari) but they can be any
type of program or device

Servers- are most often computers in the cloud

communication between clients and servers is done by request and
response

A typical HTTP Request / Response circle:

The browser requests an HTML page. The server returns an HTML file.
The browser requests a style sheet. The server returns a CSS file.
The browser requests an JPG image. The server returns a JPG ile.
The browser requests JavaScript code. The server returns a JS file
The browser requests data. The server returns data (in XML or JSON).

Server side - Backend
Client side - Frontend

DNS - convert the name of the domains in IP Adress for browsers
can load the resources from the internet

HTTPS - is a secure version of HTTP which is the primary protocol used to send data between a web browser
HTTPS is encrypted in order to increase security of data transfer. This is particularly important when
users transmit sensitive data, such as by logging into a banck account, email service or health insurance
provider

Any website, especially those that require login credentials should use HTTPS

Web Services

- is available over the internet or private(intranet)
- Uses a standardized XML messaging system

I created a little system of pages to have a different navigation on my study
for me its more easy to access all my content using this page called index.html
